## Primitives (Scalar Types)

### Integers
- In Rust, integers are a primitive data type that represent whole numbers. They are used to represent numerical values in programs, and can be used in a variety of ways, such as for counting, indexing, and arithmetic operations.
- There are several integer types available in Rust, each with a different range of values they can represent. The most common integer types are:
  - i8, i16, i32, and i64: signed integers that can represent negative and positive values. The number in their names represents the number of bits they use to store their values.
  - u8, u16, u32, and u64: unsigned integers that can represent only positive values. The number in their names represents the number of bits they use to store their values.
- In addition to these types, Rust also has two more integer types:
  - isize and usize: signed and unsigned integers that can represent the size of a pointer on the current platform. On 32-bit platforms, they are 32 bits long, and on 64-bit platforms, they are 64 bits long.
- Integers in Rust can be created using literals, such as 42 or 0xff, or by using expressions and variables. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on integers, and there are also bitwise operations such as bitwise and (&), bitwise or (|), and bitwise not (!).
- It's important to note that when performing arithmetic operations on integers, Rust will check for overflow and panic at runtime if an overflow occurs. This is to prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities in programs. However, there are also ways to handle overflow situations explicitly, such as using the Wrapping struct to perform arithmetic operations with wrapping behavior instead of panicking.
```
fn main() {
   // Scalar types: int, float, loolean, char
   //Unsigned -  never negative - u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
   //Signed -  can we negative and positive - i8, i16, i32 (default), i64, i128, isize
 println!("Max size of u32: {}", u32::MAX);
 println!("Max size of u64: {}", u64::MAX);
 println!("Max size of i32: {}", i32::MAX);
 println!("Max size of i64: {}", i64::MAX);
 println!("Max size of usize: {}", usize::MAX);
 println!("Max size of isize: {}", isize::MAX);
}
```

### Floats
- In Rust, floats are a primitive data type that represent floating-point numbers. They are used to represent numerical values that have a fractional component or a very large or very small value.
- There are two main types of floating-point numbers available in Rust:
  - f32: a 32-bit floating-point number, which can represent values with a precision of roughly 7 decimal digits.
  - f64: a 64-bit floating-point number, which can represent values with a precision of roughly 16 decimal digits.
- Floats in Rust are stored using the IEEE 754 standard, which is also used by most other programming languages and hardware architectures.
- Floats in Rust can be created using literals, such as 3.14 or 2.0e-5, or by using expressions and variables. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on floats, and there are also special functions available for more complex operations, such as sqrt, sin, cos, and exp.
- It's important to note that floats in Rust, and in most other programming languages, have limited precision and can introduce rounding errors when performing calculations. This is due to the fact that floats are represented using a finite number of bits, and not all decimal values can be accurately represented in binary form. As a result, it's important to be aware of these limitations when working with floats and to use appropriate techniques to minimize rounding errors, such as rounding or using integer arithmetic when possible.
```
fn main() {
 //floats - f32, f64 (default)
 println!("Max size of f32: {}", f32::MAX);
 println!("Max size of f64: {}", f64::MAX);
}
```

### Boolean
- In Rust, a boolean is a primitive data type that represents a logical value of either true or false. Booleans are used to represent conditions or to control the flow of a program based on a certain condition.
- Booleans in Rust are represented using the **bool** type. This type can only have two possible values: true or false. Booleans can be created using literals, such as true or false, or by using expressions and variables.
- Boolean expressions are used to create logical conditions in Rust. These expressions can be created using comparison operators such as == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), and >= (greater than or equal to). Logical operators such as && (and), || (or), and ! (not) can also be used to create more complex boolean expressions.
- Boolean values are often used in Rust to control the flow of a program using conditional statements such as if and else.
- In addition to conditional statements, boolean values can also be used in loops, function returns, and other control structures to determine program behavior based on a logical condition.

### Characters
- In Rust, a char is a primitive data type that represents a single Unicode character. Unicode is a character encoding standard that allows characters from different writing systems, languages, and cultures to be represented using a common set of codes.
- In Rust, char values are represented using a 32-bit / 4-bytes Unicode scalar value. This means that they can represent characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) as well as supplementary characters that require more than one code point to represent.
- Chars in Rust can be created using literals, such as 'a', 'üëç', or '\u{1F44D}'. Chars can also be created from integer values using the std::char::from_u32 function, which returns an Option<char> value that represents the Unicode character corresponding to the given integer code point.
- Chars in Rust can be compared using operators such as == and !=, and can also be used in string operations and indexing operations. It's important to note that chars in Rust are not the same as strings, which are represented using the String or &str types.
- When working with char values in Rust, it's important to be aware of Unicode normalization issues, which can arise when comparing or manipulating Unicode characters that have equivalent but different code point sequences. Rust provides several functions in the std::char module to handle normalization and other Unicode-related operations on char values.

## Variables
### Types of variable
- In Rust, there are three keywords used to declare variables: let, let mut, and const. These keywords have different meanings and are used to declare variables with different properties.
- **let** is used to declare an immutable variable, which means that its value cannot be changed after it has been assigned. For example:```let x = 42;```In this code, x is an immutable variable that has been assigned the value 42. If we try to reassign x to a different value, Rust will give us an error.  
- **let mut** is used to declare a mutable variable, which means that its value can be changed after it has been assigned. For example:```let mut x = 42; x = 43;```In this code, x is a mutable variable that has been assigned the value 42. We can then reassign x to a different value without any errors.
- **const** is used to declare a constant variable, which means that its value cannot be changed after. it has been assigned. Constants are always immutable, and their values must be known at compile time. For example:```const PI: f32 = 3.14159;```In this code, PI is a constant variable that has been assigned the value 3.14159. We cannot change the value of PI at runtime.
- It's important to choose the appropriate variable type for a given use case in Rust. If a variable does not need to be modified after it has been assigned, it should be declared as an immutable variable using let. If a variable needs to be modified after it has been assigned, it should be declared as a mutable variable using let mut. If a value is known at compile time and will not change during program execution, it should be declared as a constant using const.
```
// Constants
/*  
It work as global variable and faster and immutable
synatx : const SCREENCASE: variable_type = value
 */
const ABC: i32 = 17; 

fn main() {
    // variable are immutable
   let hello = "Hello Word";
   println!("{}",hello);

   // muatble eg 
   let mut hello1 = "I am hello";
   println!("hello1 before mutable: {}",hello1);
   hello1 = "I am mutable hello";
   println!("hello1 after mutable:{}", hello1);

    // eg 3
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    println!("Math in rust {} + {}  = {}",x,y,x+y);

    // Constants
    println!("{}",ABC);
}
```

### Scope and Shadowing
- In Rust, scope refers to the region of a program where a variable is valid and accessible. Variables declared inside a block or a function have a limited scope and are only accessible within that block or function, while variables declared outside of any block or function have a global scope and are accessible throughout the program.
- For example, consider the following code:
```
let x = 42;
{
  let y = 43;
  println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y); 
}
println!("x: {}", x);
```
- In this code, x is declared outside of any block and has a global scope, while y is declared inside a block and has a limited scope. The first println! statement inside the block can access both x and y, while the second println! statement outside the block can only access x.
- Shadowing is a feature in Rust that allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as an existing variable in the same scope. This can be useful for changing the type or value of a variable without having to use a different name.
- For example, consider the following code:
```let x = 42;
let x = "hello";
println!("x: {}", x);
 ```
- In this code, x is first declared as an integer, and then shadowed by a new declaration that assigns a string value to it. The final println! statement will print the string value of x.
- Shadowing can also be used to convert a mutable variable into an immutable variable. For example:
```
let mut x = 42;
x = 43;
let x = x;
println!("x: {}", x);
```
- In this code, x is first declared as a mutable variable and assigned the value 42. It is then reassigned the value 43. Finally, x is shadowed by a new declaration that makes it immutable and assigns it the current value of x. The final println! statement will print the value 43.
- Shadowing is a powerful feature in Rust, but it can also be confusing if used excessively or without a clear purpose. It's important to use shadowing judiciously and to choose descriptive variable names to avoid name collisions and improve code readability.
